Paris, Versailles, Bordeaux, Nice, Aix-en-Provence, Marseille … France is, to the eye of many, one of the centers of the western architecture—and, broadly speaking, of the architecture itself—by its incredible heritage from Ancient Times, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the 19th and 20th centuries. A heritage tantamount to those of many European countries, such as Italy and some of its beautiful and eternal cities like Rome, Genoa, Florence or Milano. 

Nonetheless, in spite of this legacy, architecture in France—though not dying—is going through hard times, to say the least. Rough times that mainly burden the vast majority of the architects, but not—or less—the renowned and quite important architecture firms, which the people see the most.

The things from which those hard times stem from are jeopardizing the profession in its current form and could therefore nearly wipe out the presence of art and beauty in the buildings, constructions and cities made in the whole continent. I’ll try, with my knowledge and the fruits of my discussions with my father, who has been an architect for almost 40 years, to explain why.

## What is the purpose of an architect?

To understand what is currently undermining the architects, I must try to explain what their role in the first place is.

For that, I’ll try to clear in a very simple way the confusion that people tend to make between the roles of an engineer and architect when speaking of construction, roles that are complementary and indivisible. 

The former, with his theoretical knowledge and skills, implements given plans and proceeds to needed adjustments and modifications, for instance when the building’s foundations need to be redesigned once the precise nature of the terrain is determined (e.g. the grounds were found to be hollow), or when the structure of the building itself needs to be changed when the properties of certain materials are clearly identified (e.g. the glass going to be used distorts itself more than expected).

The latter, in addition to his skills with which he conceives the plans of a building, must—before everything else—have an idea. An idea around which the whole project is based, that makes sense, that has a meaning and a purpose, and that lasts way beyond the construction of the project itself, through generations and time. Ideas upon which were built the Coliseum, St Peter’s Basilica, the Palace of Versailles, the Eiffel Tower, the Sagrada Familia or the Willis Tower—or, more modestly, the millions of buildings and houses designed by architects that shape the most beautiful cities on the planet—that went and will go through the ages.

## How the profession evolved in France the last decades

In the wake of the Second World War until the late sixties, an architect’s recognition stemmed mostly from its studies. If he graduated from a famous art and architecture school like the Beaux Arts in Paris, with honors such as a prize like the Prix de Rome, most of the projects would come directly to him, except from the most prestigious and important ones that would nevertheless require an architecture competition. Hence the architects’ destinies where quite sealed: the most recognized ones that managed to brilliantly achieve their studies were to have the lion’s share, while the others were to live with what remained. 

But, in 1968, a lot of things changed in the education system. The academic recognition was questioned in architecture as well as in every other domain and lost its clout. Thus, architecture competitions became almost mandatory for a growing number of projects, giving to modest architects that didn’t made brilliant studies their chances to win almost anything. Nowadays, these competitions concern almost virtually any project as soon as it is medium-sized (starting from 1500-2000 square meters).

## Too many architectural competitions are detrimental to the profession

Now, architectural competitions might seem to be a good thing because they favor the rise of unknown architects and promote a wider variety of arts and styles. In fact, they foster a concentration that reduces the number of architects able to compete. 

Architectural competitions generate a high amount of costs. Many things need to be done to apply to these competitions: preliminary but complex plans, pricey 3D visuals and videos, various kinds of supports, and of course long brainstorming sessions to come up with the best and most relevant idea to win. Although there are compensations to offset what is spent by the architects during their preparations, they barely cover the costs (only half of them most of the time) and are definitely not enough to make a living.  

Since competitions became common practice for most projects in France, the biggest agencies are thus the only ones that can withstand such losses and engage in those preparations with a reasonable chance to win.

## The rise of new technologies overhauls the way projects are being conceived

There is a second factor on the “architecture market” that contributes to concentrate the supply: the rise of new technologies. As in almost every sector of the economy, these have profoundly reshaped the profession since the end of the 1980s.

These new technologies are mainly software conception products to draw plans, the most commonly and internationally used being AutoCAD—created by the American firm Autodesk—that allows to create extremely precise 2D plans. These have completely replaced the hundreds of sheet and layers that were once used to conceive a project. And there are considerably more expensive: the licenses of these software products are the third item of expenditures for most agencies, after the renting costs and wages. It roughly represents for a big firm that makes 30 million euros revenue more than 700 000 euros a year, which is huge since such a firm generates in the best case 2 to 3 million euros of profits—if it didn’t lose too much competitions.

There are even more expensive software products, like the 3D planning and interactive software Revit (also developed by Autodesk) that allows all the stakeholders of a project to use a single platform (electrical or plumber engineers can work as well as the architects on the plans created). This software product costs more than 10 000 euros a year per computer.

These expenses are much higher that the papers and pencils used before. Small agencies hence struggle more to make ends meet.

Moreover, it also generates an indirect cost: it is quite complicated to assess the individual work of an architect working on these software products—since its work is diluted with the others’—whereas before, on sheet and layers, its individual work could be assessed easily. Thus, it is harder to detect unproductive or, on the other and, talentuous architects: only the biggest companies can really sustain the luxury of a long period of time to see if the employees they are paying are productive or not.

## In addition of a competition increase between architects, the rise of engineering agencies

Engineering agencies are composed of various kinds of experts that work with the architects to implement the plans they conceived.

But, during the last three decades, engineering agencies have been gradually doing tasks that were once the architects’ for a lower price. For instance, they are now in charge, during the realization process of a lot projects, of the work coordination and direction—a role that the architect once did most of the time as the “conductor” of his idea and the one who would ensure that its realization is close to what he had in mind. 

They even perform sometimes the conception aspect of some projects, leaving to the architects the sole task of coming up with an idea and realizing a preliminary plan, mandatory in a lot of countries like France to be issued a building permit. Nowadays, some architects working alone or in small agencies in France are sometimes only doing these “preliminary plans” and not the whole project to give building permits to their customers—the latter working afterwards with engineering agencies, and not with the architects with whom they should have worded. 

The fact that engineering agencies are gradually doing the work of architects is partially due to the growing number of intermediates, like real estate managers, that are in charge of finding the right stakeholders to realize the projects of their customers, and are hence the ones who deal with architects and engineers with a goal of maximum profitability in mind—art becoming secondary. The real customer—the one who pays for the project—deals less with the architects, with whom he is generally more prone to have a discussion with them about the artistic idea upon which the project should be based, because he generally puts a higher premium on it than the intermediates.

## The decline of French and European architecture

We’ve seen that the growing number of architectural competitions, the costs of new technologies and the competition that stems from engineering agencies promoted by intermediates are harming small and medium-sized architecture agencies, allowing only the biggest ones to realize important projects. Only these agencies can thus survive on the long-term given the circumstances, yet not without difficulties. 

I understand that some could wonder if this is a bad thing after all. Do we really need pricey architects in medium-sized agencies to do things that could be done by big agencies or engineering agencies? I think the answer is yes, because it reduces the variety of arts and styles, and drives the whole construction sector to a maximum profitability mindset, which will produce tasteless buildings, constructions and cities that would be far from what the marvels of our history are.

## The American model: a relevant way for European architects to take on the challenge

The “American model” is, in fact, the “Anglo-Saxon model”: it encompasses the way that American, but also British and Japanese architecture agencies work. 

These three countries are the home of the biggest agencies in the word. The biggest French and European agencies are pale in comparison.  The American agencies like Gensler or HOK, the British agencies like Adeas or Foster & Partners, or the Japanese agencies like Nikken Sekkei, are composed of more than 1000 architects, while the biggest one in France barely reaches the 300. Their revenues follow the same proportions.

When competing on the international stage—which, as we’ve seen, now concerns a lot of projects—the biggest Anglo-Saxon agencies, because of the things mentioned above, are outperforming both in terms of notoriety and capacity the European ones, hence making it hard for them to close significant deals.

## The European states must lift the investment cap limiting their architecture agencies’ size

What European countries must do, like in France, is to encourage its biggest architectures agencies to grow in size. For that, they must lift the investment limit that is crippling them. In France, maximum 25% of an agency’s equity can be detained by investors, and in Italy, this limit is near zero, whereas in the US, the UK or Japan, this limit simply does not exist.

This limit has been set to prevent big agencies from concentrating the architects and depriving them from their creativity, and to allow free-lance architects to make a living far from the big cities and provide the whole population with their services. But in reality, it undermines the biggest agencies of the concerned countries, and the whole profession. Indeed, a lot of small and medium-sized agencies work alongside the biggest ones, and also benefit from their recognition on the international stage in a trickle-down approach. The “25% investment cap” is then a prejudice for all architects, and is definitely not the way to protect it. Architecture agencies need to expand to face all the costs that are inherently growing because of the profession’s transformation.

## Architects and engineers must merge their skills

Apart from this piece of legislation that needs to be changed to liberate the striving potential of European architecture agencies, these must also have an in-depth thinking about the way the very role of the architects must evolve.

In the US or UK, engineers and architects work together and are starting to share their skills. Architecture and engineering agencies are merging to form common structures, able to both develop ideas and implement them.

In Europe, both professions must merge as well to adapt to the changes of tomorrow. This can be done in the first place by the merger of architecture and engineering agencies, as some already did in Europe, like “AIA Nantes”, a French architecture agency located in Nantes which merged with another architecture agency in Lyon and an engineering agency in Paris, thus creating a structure composed of architects and engineers able to perform a broad range of tasks, and to share their skills and points of view.

## Big architecture and engineering agencies with local roots would stop European architecture’s downslide

The goal of getting rid of the investment limit to attract investors while merging with other structures yielding complementary skills is to create viable European agencies that could compete to the international level, while responding properly to the local demand. 

With a significantly higher participation from investors as well as an increase in skills and manpower with relevant mergers, the biggest agencies would be able to perform all the tasks needed to achieve big projects both on the national and international scales. They would be able to settle in foreign countries, while having a network of premises in their homeland to understand local stakes, so that small cities and countryside could benefit from their expertise. 

Free-lance architects and medium-sized agencies would benefit from this renewal, and could cooperate with these agencies or just take advantage of the activity’s new dynamism to make a living.

This would also make the biggest European agencies more sustainable. Many architecture agencies die with their founders because they represent its style and value to the eyes of many, especially the buyers. The agencies that would engage in the endeavor described above and come out from this transformation would be able to survive their founders because of their size and range of skills. American, British and Japanese biggest agencies survived their founders because they were big enough and developed an excellent expertise. 

Some European agencies—at least in France—have already begun to follow that path, still limited by the lack of funds because of the current legislation. Getting some inspiration from the Anglo-Saxon model while still maintaining local roots by merging with other agencies and creating a national network definitely seem to be a relevant way for the European agencies to survive and continuing to spread art and style that are of paramount importance in what we build—and what we are.

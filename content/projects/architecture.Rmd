Paris, Versailles, Bordeaux, Nice, Aix-en-Provence, Marseille … France is, to the eye of many, one of the centers of the western architecture—and, broadly speaking, of the architecture itself—by its incredible heritage from Ancient Times, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the 19th and 20th centuries. A heritage tantamount to those of many European countries, such as Italy and some of its beautiful and eternal cities like Rome, Genoa, Florence or Milano. 

Nonetheless, in spite of this legacy, architecture in France—though not dying—is going through hard times, to say the least. Rough times that mainly burden the vast majority of the architects, but not—or less—the renowned and quite important architecture firms, which the people see the most.

The things from which those hard times stem from are jeopardizing the profession in its current form and could therefore nearly wipe out the presence of art and beauty in the buildings, constructions and cities made in the whole continent.

## What is the purpose of an architect?

To understand what is currently undermining the architects, one most understand what their role in the first place is.

For that, one has to distinguish the roles of an engineer and architect; roles that are complementary and indivisible. 

The former, with his theoretical knowledge and skills, implements given plans and proceeds to needed adjustments and modifications, for instance when the building’s foundations need to be redesigned once the precise nature of the terrain is determined (e.g. the grounds were found to be hollow), or when the structure of the building itself needs to be changed when the properties of certain materials are clearly identified (e.g. the glass going to be used distorts itself more than expected).

The latter, in addition to his skills with which he conceives the plans of a building, must—before everything else—have an idea. An idea around which the whole project is based, that makes sense, that has a meaning and a purpose, and that lasts way beyond the construction of the project itself, through generations and time. Ideas upon which were built the Coliseum, St Peter’s Basilica, the Palace of Versailles, the Eiffel Tower, the Sagrada Familia or the Willis Tower—or, more modestly, the millions of buildings and houses designed by architects that shape the most beautiful cities on the planet—that went and will go through the ages.

## How the profession evolved in France the last decades

In the wake of the Second World War until the late sixties, an architect’s recognition stemmed mostly from its studies. If he graduated from a famous art and architecture school like the Beaux Arts in Paris, with honors such as a prize like the Prix de Rome, most of the projects would come directly to him, except from the most prestigious and important ones that would nevertheless require an architectural competition. Hence the architects’ destinies where quite sealed: the most recognized ones that managed to brilliantly achieve their studies were to have the lion’s share of the projects, while the others were to live with what remained. 

But, in 1968, a lot of things changed in the education system. The academic recognition was questioned in architecture as well as in every other domain and lost its clout. Thus, architecture competitions became almost mandatory for a growing number of projects, increasing the chances of modest architects that did not went to the most prestigious schools to work on greater projects. Nowadays, these competitions concern almost virtually any project as soon as it is medium-sized (starting from 1500-2000 square meters).

## Too many architectural competitions are detrimental to the profession

Architectural competitions might be seen as an improvement because they favor the rise of unknown architects and promote a wider variety of arts and styles. However, they foster a concentration that reduces the number of architects able to compete. 

Architectural competitions generate a high amount of costs. Many things need to be done to apply to these competitions: preliminary but complex plans, pricey 3D visuals and videos, various kinds of supports, and of course long brainstorming sessions to come up with the best and most relevant idea to win. Although there are compensations to offset what is spent by the architects during their preparations, they barely cover the costs (only half of them most of the time) and are definitely not enough to make a living.

Since competitions became common practice for most projects in France, the biggest agencies are thus the only ones that can withstand such losses and engage in those preparations with a reasonable chance to win.

## The rise of new technologies overhauls the way projects are being conceived

There is a second factor on the architecture market that contributes to concentrate the supply: the rise of new technologies. As in almost every sector of the economy, these have profoundly reshaped the profession since the end of the 1980s.

These new technologies are mainly software conception products to draw plans; the most commonly and internationally used is AutoCAD—created by the American firm Autodesk—that allows to create extremely precise 2D plans. These have completely replaced the hundreds of sheet and layers that were once used to conceive a project, but are considerably more expensive: the licenses of these software products are the third item of expenditures for most architecture agencies, after the renting costs and wages. It roughly represents for a big firm that makes €30mn revenue more than €700K a year, a huge amount given that such a firm generates in good years €2mn to €↨3mn of profits.

There are even more expensive software products, like the 3D planning and interactive software Revit (also developed by Autodesk) that allows all the stakeholders of a project to use a single platform (electrical or plumber engineers can work along with architects and many other stakeholders on the same plans). This software product costs more than €10K a year per licence.

These expenses are much higher that the papers and pencils used before. Consequently, small agencies hence struggle more to make ends meet.

Moreover, these softwares also generate an indirect cost: assessing the individual work of an architect working on these software products becomes indeed quite complex—since its work is diluted with the others’—whereas before, on sheets and layers, individual work could be assessed easily. Thus, it is harder to detect unproductive or, on the other and, talentuous architects: only the most prominent companies can really sustain the luxury of a long period of time to assess the productivity of their pricey workforce.

## In addition of a competition increase between architects, the rise of engineering agencies

Engineering agencies are composed of various kinds of experts that work with the architects to implement the plans they conceived.

But, during the last three decades, engineering agencies have been gradually doing tasks that were once the architects’ for a lower price. For instance, they are now in charge, during the realization process of many projects, of the work of coordination and direction; this role was before performed by the architect since they were the “conductor” of their idea and the one who would ensure that its realization was close to what they had in mind. 

They even perform sometimes the conception aspect of some projects, leaving to the architects the sole task of coming up with an idea and realizing a preliminary plan which is mandatory in many countries such as France to be issued a building permit. Nowadays, some architects working alone or in small agencies in France are sometimes pigeonholed in doing these “preliminary plans” instead of entire projects only to give building permits to their customers, the latter working afterwards with engineering agencies, and not with the architects with whom they should have worded. 

The fact that engineering agencies are gradually doing the work of architects is partially due to the growing number of intermediates, such as real estate managers, who are in charge of finding the right stakeholders to realize their customers' projects; these intermediates deal with architects and engineers to maximize profitability, art becoming secondary. The real customer—the one who pays for the project—deals less with the architects, with whom he is generally more prone to have a discussion about the artistic idea upon which the project should be based, because they generally put a higher premium on it than the intermediates.

## The decline of French and European architecture

We have seen that the growing number of architectural competitions, the costs of new technologies and the competition that stems from engineering agencies promoted by intermediates are harming small and medium-sized architecture agencies, allowing only the biggest ones to realize important projects. Only these agencies can thus survive on the long-term given the circumstances, yet not without difficulties. 

One could wonder is this situation is necessarily a bad one. Do we really need pricey architects in medium-sized agencies to do things that could be done by big agencies or engineering agencies? I think the answer is yes, because it reduces the variety of arts and styles, and drives the whole construction sector to a maximum profitability mindset which yields produce soulless buildings, constructions and cities whose artistic dimension pales in comparison to the historic centres of our cities.

## The American model: a relevant way for European architects to take on the challenge

The “American model” is, in fact, the “Anglo-Saxon model”: it encompasses the way that American, but also British and Japanese architecture agencies work. 

These three countries are the home of the biggest agencies in the word; the largest French and European agencies are pale in comparison.  American agencies such as Gensler or HOK, British agencies such as Adeas or Foster & Partners, or Japanese agencies such as Nikken Sekkei, are all composed of more than 1000 architects, while the largest one in France barely reaches the 300. Their revenues follow the same proportions.

When competing on the international stage—which, as we’ve seen, is the competitive scene of numerous projects—the largest Anglo-Saxon agencies are outperforming both in terms of notoriety and capacity the European ones, hence making it hard for them to close significant deals.

## The European states must lift the investment cap limiting their architecture agencies’ size

What European countries must do, like in France, is to encourage its biggest architectures agencies to grow in size. For that, they must lift the investment limit that is crippling them. In France, a maximum of 25% of an architecture agency’s equity can be detained by non-architects shareholder; in Italy, this limit is near zero. In the US, the UK or Japan, this cap does not exist.

This limit has been set to prevent big agencies from concentrating the architects and depriving them from their creativity, and to allow free-lance architects to make a living far from the big cities and provide the whole population and large geographical areas with their services. But in reality, the cap undermines the largest agencies and the whole profession. Indeed, a lot of small and medium-sized agencies work alongside the biggest ones, and also benefit from their recognition on the international stage in a trickle-down approach. Architecture agencies need to expand to face all the costs that are inherently growing because of the profession’s transformation.

## Architects and engineers must merge their skills

Apart from this piece of legislation that needs to be changed to liberate the striving potential of European architecture agencies, these must also have an in-depth thinking about the way the very role of the architects must evolve.

In the US or UK, engineers and architects work together and are starting to share their skills. Architecture and engineering agencies are merging to form common structures, able to both develop ideas and implement them.

In Europe, both professions must merge as well to adapt to the changes of tomorrow. This can be done in the first place by the merger of architecture and engineering agencies, as some already did in Europe, like “AIA Nantes”, a French architecture agency located in Nantes which merged with another architecture agency in Lyon and an engineering agency in Paris, thus creating a structure composed of architects and engineers able to perform a broad range of tasks, and to share their skills and points of view.

## Large architecture and engineering agencies with local roots would stop European architecture’s downslide

The goal of getting rid of the equity cap to attract investors while merging with other structures yielding complementary skills is to create viable European agencies that could compete on the international level while responding properly to the local demand. 

With a significantly higher participation from investors as well as an increase in skills and manpower with relevant mergers, the largest agencies would be able to perform all the tasks needed to achieve important projects both on the national and international scales. They would be able to expand in foreign countries while having a network of premises in their homeland to comprehend local stakes, so that small cities and the countryside could benefit from their expertise. 

Free-lance architects and medium-sized agencies would benefit from this model as well, and could cooperate with these agencies or just take advantage of the activity’s new dynamism to improve their economic situation.

Furthermore, this would make the largest European agencies more sustainable. Many architecture agencies die with their founders because they represent their style and values to the eyes of their customers; once the founders are gone, their agencies lose their prestige and become worthless. The agencies that would engage in the endeavor described above and come out from this transformation would be able to survive their founders because of their size and range of skills, as the largest American, British and Japanese agencies survived because their size and excellent expertise allowed them to outlive their founders.

Some European agencies—at least in France—have already begun to follow that path, still limited by the lack of capital because of the current legislation. Getting some inspiration from the Anglo-Saxon model while still maintaining local roots by merging with other agencies and creating a national network definitely seems to be a relevant way for the European agencies to survive and continue to spread art and style that are of paramount importance in what we build—and what we are.

<p>This is a statistical analysis I did of the <a href="https://www.liv-ex.com/news-insights/indices/" target="_blank">Liv-ex Fine Wine 100 index</a> using the software <a href="https://www.eviews.com/home.html" target="_blank">EViews</a>. This analysis was done during the elective “Time Series Analysis” at <a href="https://www.london.edu/" target="_blank">London Business School</a> taught by <a href="https://www.london.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/b/bunn-dw" target="_blank">Prof. Derek Bunn</a>.</p>

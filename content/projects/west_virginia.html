<p>The well-known 1971 John Denver’s single describes what West Virginia evokes to most people: the countryside, the home of true America, where its spirit lies.</p>
<p>To understand why this state embodies most of America’s heritage, a bit of historical context will prove useful. Virginia is originally the first state of the Thirteen Colonies, and hence virtually the first state of the United States. Discovered in 1584 by British explorers, it was where the first European colonists settled in North America. It became an American state in 1776 thanks to the declaration of independence, and near a century later—in 1861—seceded to join the Confederation.</p>
<p>The Civil War is the event from which West Virginia stems from: in 1863, it declared independence from Virginia to join the Union, one year before the end of the bloodiest war on the American soil. The Northern and most rural part of the state hence became another state itself, whereas the rest—its wealthiest and most industrialized part—remained in the Confederation.</p>
<p>From then, the economy of West Virginia continued to develop based on agriculture, and afterwards coal at the end of the 19th century. Later, due to productivity gains in the coal industry and agriculture—in addition to the pressure of a widening globalization—the rate of unemployment and the number of low paid jobs soared at the end of the seventies. In the wake of the nineties, the economy started to really struggle. Nowadays, though the official unemployment rate is low (below 5%), most people have low paid and part time jobs, and a weak purchasing power. Moreover, people lost meaningful occupations: a lot of miners had to find another activity to make a living, and a lot of farmers fled the State.</p>

<h2>The feeling of being home</h2>
<p>When I came in West Virginia for the first time, seven years ago, I sensed the smell and spirit of America, and the dreams of the newcomers that settled there. I stayed in a house between White Sulfur Springs and Gap Mills, two small towns populated by twenty people at most, the majority of them being Mennonites. The house itself—very typical—was made of wood, built at the end of the 19th century, with a small barn nearby to shelter cattle, and a wheat field down the front porch. While watching it, one could easily picture a family, probably an immigrant one, that came here more than a century ago, and that bought a small piece of land to begin a new and a simple life, in the midst of nature and mountains: build a house, raise cattle, harvest wheat, and live happy.</p>
<p>This feeling of “being home” attracts some tourists since the seventies, the majority of them coming from rich cities like Boston, New York or Atlanta, that are from a few hours’ drive—or, for those who have the means, from a one-hour flight—of the airports of Roanoke, VA, close to West Virginia, or Lewisburg, WA.</p>
<p>They come to enjoy few days breaks—often going in fancy hotels and resorts, like the well-known Greenbrier Resort (where Trump celebrated last July the American Independence), near the river of the same name—wandering around the state’s beautiful landscapes, and some of the trendy shops and coffees in towns like Lewisburg, which was once awarded with the title of “America’s coolest small town”. Some people also settle here to flee the big coastal cities and their economic and social turmoil, to take up again with nature and to consume as few resources as possible. They sometimes live in small communities, whose members provide each other with help and assistance, and trade some groceries or products they produce themselves (that are often organic).</p>

<h2>Make West Virginia great again</h2>

<em>Image source: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-west-virginia-campaign-rally-election-2016" target="_blank">theguardian.com</a></em></p>
<p>This is one face of West Virginia: a beautiful, rural state, amid the Appalachians, a bit confidential, where some initiated tourists go to enjoy beautiful landscapes, and some coastal cities dwellers decide to live to rest from their intense life. A state that breathes and embodies the American spirit, and the history of the first people that made it.</p>
<p>The other face of West Virginia is gloomier, but all the more interesting and relevant today. As mentioned, several people lost their jobs in the coal mining industry and agriculture during the second half of the last century, two sectors which were the backbone of the state’s economy. As a result, people were forced to find part time and low paid jobs or to leave the state. The consequence is that a wide unhappiness and discontent spread across the state; people felt—quite righteously—like they were left hang out to dry, since they were honestly hardly a priority for Washington.</p>
<p>There are indeed clear signs of social distress: West Virginia is the state that has the highest—from far—drug overdose death rate in the United States: over 50 overdoses each year for 100 000 people. It also has the lowest income per capita. A 3-hour tour in the state in enough to see number of small cities or hamlets that are on the edge of becoming—or already are—ghost towns, crossed by trains filled to the brim with coal that go through abandoned train stations, and numerous collapsing farms and barns that were left several years ago.</p>
<p>This is the kind of situation that makes people craving for change. West Virginia is among the states that voted the most for candidates that were anti-establishment and willing to make big overhauls to the economy and the social system. Hence, in WV, Bernie Sanders won the democratic primary, and Donald Trump made there his highest score of the fifty US states.</p>
<p>These two candidates, especially Donald Trump, appealed to West Virginia ballot casters by showing concern for the Americans that lived between the two very rich coasts of the US. For instance, Donald Trump made the promise—and held it—to subsidize the coal industry, the kind of vows that made him sway many votes in West Virginia and other States in the rust belt, whereas the democrats—often viewed as technocrats far away from the American countryside, vying for power in Washington and solving only the richest and most educated citizens’ problems, like the global warming—were far from having such momentum.</p>
<p>That’s why, in my opinion, West Virginia encompasses quite well, from a European perspective, what the United States are—and, more broadly, the Western countries—going through. This beautiful piece of land, amid the mountains, composed of breath-taking landscapes, filled with American history and struggling to cope with the centralization of powers and the globalization of the economy, illustrates the fight between the old and the new world: West Virginia embodies the violence of economic transformation that forces territories and countries to choose between significantly reshaping their way of living, or being left behind.</p>

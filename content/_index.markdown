## INTRODUCTION

Hello! I was born in Paris, France. I studied in Paris and Bordeaux, and did a couple of internships in Paris. After those experiences, I wanted to live and work abroad. I therefore decided to move to London, UK to study and then work full time.

I use this website to post my R projects as well as a few essays.
